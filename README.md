## ✨ What Does It Do?

Your **Minimal Callable Product (MCP)** is a smart workflow that turns a simple idea into a ready-to-refine blog post. It automates:

* **💡 Idea to Draft:** Input a topic in Google Sheets, get an AI-generated draft.
* **📝 Auto-Organize:** Documents are created in Google Docs, saved to your Google Drive.
* **✅ Track Everything:** Progress and links are updated in Notion and back in your Google Sheet.

## 🛠️ Why Did I Build It? (Problems Solved)

I built this because manual content work is:

* **⏰ Time-Consuming:** Endless copying, pasting, and organizing.
* **🗑️ Disorganized:** Hard to track progress or find files across platforms.
* **📉 Inconsistent:** Quality varies with manual drafting.

My MCP fixes this by making the process **fast, organized, and standardized!**
